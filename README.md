# **quMCMC**
This repository contains the python implementation of Quantum Enhanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo. The code is based mainly on the algorithm reported by David Layden et al. in **Quantum-enhanced Markov chain Monte Carlo**. The code provides support for reproducing most of the results discussed in the original paper, and the adavantages of the Quantum Enhanced MCMC (*quMCMC*) over classical MCMC has been highlighted.




### **Installation**

The package can be installed using `pip` in the main directory of the package as,

```bash
>>> pip install .
```
<!-- ### **Usage** -->
